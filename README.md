# GDP Data Analysis and World Breakdown

### Questions that we will be investigating calling upon the data set:

1 Match the data based on the country shortcode. How many of the IDs match?
2 Sort the data frame in ascending order by GDP rank (so United States is last). What is the
13th country in the resulting data frame?
3 What are the average GDP rankings for the "High income: OECD" and "High income:
nonOECD" groups?
4 Plot the GDP for all of the countries. Use ggplot2 to color your plot by Income Group.
5 Cut the GDP ranking into 5 separate quantile groups. Make a table versus Income.Group.
How many countries are Lower middle income but among the 38 nations with highest
GDP?
